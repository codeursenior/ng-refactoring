# NgRefactoring

A repository for practicing refactoring based on the reference book "Refactoring" by Martin Fowler in the context of an Angular application.

## Inital setup

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `ng serve --open`. 

The webapp will be automatically opened in your browser at `http://localhost:4200/`. 

> üê±‚Äçüë§ The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
